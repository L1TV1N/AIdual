Such a great joke runs the forest suddenly hears through the forest
Runes
And there is a trap and in a trap, the wolf came in the face
Suitable for the wolf, the tail picked up
such a beautiful wolf runs
I pulled my face from this trap rushed
hears the chase sees the swamp jump into the swamp
You hear
you haven't seen a hare, I don't talk to fagots
